# ConcurrentQtVTKApp

## Overview
ConcurrentQtVTKApp is a desktop application developed using Qt that harnesses the power of concurrency for parallel computations on user-selected data structures. The application offers a graphical interface and utilizes VTK (Visualization Toolkit) objects to present the computed results visually.

## Features
- **Concurrency:** Utilizes Qt's concurrency features to perform simultaneous calculations.
- **Data Structure:** Users can select the data structure on which parallel computations will be performed.
- **VTK Visualization:** Displays results through VTK objects for interactive and intuitive graphical representation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the application using the provided instructions in the 'Build' section.
3. Run the executable to launch the ConcurrentQtVTKApp.

## Build
Follow these steps to build the application:
1. Install Qt.
2. Open the project in Qt Creator or use CMake.
3. Configure and generate the project.
4. Build the application.

## Usage
- Upon launching, select the target data structure.
- Initiate computations to run in parallel.
- Visualize results through the integrated VTK objects.
